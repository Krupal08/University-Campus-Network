# University Campus Network Topology in Packet Tracer

A campus is situated 20 miles apart. The students and staff are distributed in 5 faculty
-	Health
-	Science
-	Business
-	Computer Engineering
-	Art & Design
Each member of staff has pc and student have access to PCs in Labs.

Requirements A: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a network topology with the main components to support the following:
<B>Main Campus</B> 
-	Building A: Admin staff in the department of management, HR & Finance. The admin staff PCs are distributed in the building offices, and it is expected that they will share some networking equipment (use VLANs). The faculty of business is also situated in this building.

-	Building B: Faculty of computer Engineering and facility of art and design.

-	Building C: Students labs and IT departments. The IT departments hosts the university web server and other servers. There is also e-mail server hosted externally on the cloud.


<B>Smaller campus:</B>
Faculty of health and science (staff & student labs are situated on separate floor)

Requirement B: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will be expected to configure the core devices and few end devices to prove end-to-end connectivity and access to the internal servers and external servers.

i.	Each Department or faculty is expected to be on its own separate IP network.

ii.	Turn switches should be configured with separate VLANS and security settings.

iii.	RIPv2 will be used to wide routing for the routers in the internal network and static route for the external server.

iv.	The devices in building A will be expected to acquire Dynamic IP address from router-based DHCP server.

<B>Technologies Implemented:</B>

1.Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.

2.Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers.

3.Subnetting and IP Addressing.

4.Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick).

5.Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server).

6.Configuring SSH for secure Remote access.

7.Configuring RIPv2 as the routing protocol.

8.Configuring switchport security or Port-Security on the switches.

9.Host Device Configurations.

10.Test and Verifying Network Communication.
